##  Overview

The sml-movie-recommendation project is a movie recommendation system that uses machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. It utilizes various algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and collaborative filtering to analyze user preferences and recommend movies based on their past interactions. The project's core functionality involves collecting user data, processing it using machine learning models, and generating a list of movie recommendations tailored to each individual user. The value proposition of this project lies in its ability to enhance the movie-watching experience by suggesting relevant and personalized movie choices, saving users time and effort in finding movies that align with their interests.
